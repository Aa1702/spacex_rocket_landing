# 🚀 Falcon 9 Launch Success Prediction

This project is a basic machine learning model that predicts whether a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch will be successful or not based on features like payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and rocket configuration.

## 📁 Dataset
A small sample dataset (`spacex.csv`) with features such as:

- PayloadMass  
- Orbit  
- LaunchSite  
- GridFins  
- Legs  
- Reused  
- Class (1 = Success, 0 = Failure)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

---

## 🔄 ML Pipeline

- Data preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding for categorical features  
- Random Forest Classifier training  
- Evaluation using accuracy score

---

## ✅ Result
Model trained successfully on the sample data with a good accuracy score using `RandomForestClassifier`.
